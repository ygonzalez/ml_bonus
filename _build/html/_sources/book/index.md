[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) – Open Machine Learning course. __Bonus assignments__
</div>


# Welcome

Hi! In this [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) JupyterBook you'll find your Bonus Assignments. The book is organized in 10 topics closely following the publicly available [mlcourse.ai roadmap](https://mlcourse.ai/roadmap). In each section, you'll find a short intro to the topic (with links to the corresponding course materials), an assignment, and a solution to the assignment. 

Note that JupyterBook is read-only. So the best way to work with the assignments is to run `jupyter-notebook` from the root directory `mlcourse_ai_assignments_book`, and then make a copy of the notebook to work with as shown below.

## How to get help
In [ODS Slack](https://opendatascience.slack.com) (if you don't have access, you can join via the [ods.ai](https://ods.ai) "Join #slack" button), we have a channel **#mlcourse\_ai\_news** with announcements from the course team.
You can discuss the course content freely in the **#mlcourse_ai** channel (we still have a huge Russian-speaking group, they have a separate channel **#mlcourse\_ai\_rus**). For instance, the 1st bonus assignment is discussed in a dedicated pinned thread __#a1_bonus__ in the __#mlcourse\_ai\_news__ channel.

Here's how you reply in a thread (press this dialog icon to drill down into a thread):

Please use threads for your questions and help each other without sharing the correct code and answers. Also, if you spot typos or errors, please report them via the mentioned Slack threads or through the webforms for each assignment (a link to such a webform is given at the beginning of each assignment). 

Thanks for supporting the course and happy learning!
